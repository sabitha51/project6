    <p> 
        My name is Sabitha,and my favourite animal is rabit.Any of various long-eared, short-tailed mammals that have long hind legs adapted for quick movement by hopping.<br>Rabbits eat mainly plants and dig many-chambered burrows known as warrens.a small animal that usually lives in holes in the ground and has long ears,soft fur, and <br>back legs that are longer than its front legs
    They have been domesticated since ancient times.
